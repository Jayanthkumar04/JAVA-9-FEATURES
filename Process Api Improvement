Until java 8 ,communicating with processor/os/machine is very difficult.We requried to write very complex native code and
we have to ue 3rd pary jar files

1)get process id of running process
2)create new process
3)destry already running process
4)get process handles for processes
5)get parent and child proecesses of urnning process
